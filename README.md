# OU Modules Bot

Add it to your Discord server: https://add.modules-bot.ou-stem.club

OU Modules Bot is a project made for The Open University STEM Club's Discord. It's a Module Codes reference bot, useful in case you ever wonder what are the meanings of module codes which people mention. You can use it with the following types of commands:

 * `!MU123` - will display MU123's title, with a link.
 * `!MST124 !MST125` - will display both MST124 and MST125 titles, with links.
 * `!mst121 !m263 !m366` - old modules and lowercase are fine too! However, we don't provide links to discontinued modules.
